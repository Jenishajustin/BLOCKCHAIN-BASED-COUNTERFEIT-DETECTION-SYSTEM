#  Securing Pharmaceutical Supply Chains  
## Blockchain-Based Counterfeit Detection System

## Overview
Counterfeit medicines pose a serious threat to public health and the pharmaceutical industry. This project presents a **Blockchain-Based Pharma Counterfeit Detection System** that ensures secure, transparent, and tamper-proof verification of pharmaceutical products. The current implementation focuses on **smart contract development using Remix IDE**, providing a strong foundation for future full-stack integration.

---

## Objectives
- Prevent circulation of counterfeit and expired medicines  
- Ensure tamper-proof storage of pharmaceutical data  
- Automate product verification using blockchain technology  
- Improve transparency and trust in the pharmaceutical supply chain  

---

## Problem Statement
Traditional pharmaceutical supply chains rely on centralized databases that are vulnerable to manipulation and lack transparency. This allows counterfeit medicines to enter the market easily. A decentralized blockchain-based solution is required to ensure authenticity, traceability, and data integrity.

---

## Proposed Solution
The proposed system uses **Ethereum smart contracts** to register and verify pharmaceutical products. Each product is assigned a unique identifier stored on the blockchain. Smart contracts automatically validate authenticity and expiry details, ensuring that once data is recorded, it cannot be altered.

---

## System Design (Current Phase)
- Smart contracts handle:
  - Product registration  
  - Authenticity verification  
  - Expiry validation  
- Contracts are written, deployed, and tested using **Remix IDE**
- Blockchain execution is simulated using Remix’s virtual environment
